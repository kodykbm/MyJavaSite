    <h1><span>DDoS and Trojans: Understanding Cyber Attacks</span></h1>
    
    <h2>The purpose of this webpage is to educate all of you on the use of trojans to create botnets that are then used to enact Denial-of-Service Attacks.</h2>
    
    <h3>My personal experiences with DDoS Attacks have only been with game servers being interrupted and not being able to play that certain game for a couple hours, so I am very lucky. These attacks can be very dangerous when the targets are more vulnerable, such as an attack on hospital servers. Society can be negatively affected by these attacks and unknowingly be a part of them. This webpage will explain all of this and more, enjoy!</h3>
